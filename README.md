# Requirements

Our emergency application is designed to provide assistance to people during emergency situations. The following business logic steps describe how the application will work:

1. **User Registration:** Users will be required to register with the application by providing their personal details and emergency contact information. This information will be used to quickly notify their emergency contacts in case of an emergency.
2. **Emergency Alert:** In case of an emergency, users can activate the emergency alert feature on the application. This will send an alert message to their emergency contacts, along with their current location.
3. **Emergency Services:** The application will also provide users with a list of emergency services, such as hospitals, police stations, and fire stations, based on their current location. Users can use this feature to quickly find the nearest emergency service.
4. **Emergency Tips:** The application will provide users with emergency tips and guidelines to follow in various emergency situations. These tips will include information on how to perform CPR, how to stop bleeding, and other first aid procedures.
5. **Emergency Contacts:** Users will have the ability to add, edit, and delete emergency contacts in the application. They can also choose to send an alert to all or selected emergency contacts.
6. **Emergency History:** The application will maintain a history of all emergency alerts sent by the user. This will help the user keep track of their emergency alerts and provide useful information to emergency services in case of a follow-up.
7. **Feedback:** Users will have the ability to provide feedback on the application and rate the emergency services they have used. This will help improve the application and provide valuable information to other users.

These business logic steps will ensure that our emergency application provides prompt and effective assistance to users during emergency situations.

1. **Emergency Communication:** The application will provide a communication feature for users to communicate with their emergency contacts during an emergency. This feature can be used to provide additional information or instructions to the emergency contacts.
2. **Emergency Preparedness:** The application will also provide users with information on emergency preparedness, such as how to create an emergency kit and how to develop an emergency plan. This will help users be better prepared for emergency situations.
3. **Localization:** The application will be available in multiple languages and will be localized to cater to the needs of users in different regions. This will help ensure that users can easily access and use the application, regardless of their location or language.
4. **Accessibility:** The application will be designed to be accessible to users with disabilities. This will include features such as text-to-speech and voice commands, which will help users with visual or motor impairments.
5. **Security:** The application will be designed with security in mind to ensure that users' personal information and emergency alerts are kept secure. This will include features such as encryption and secure user authentication.

By incorporating these additional features, our emergency application will provide a comprehensive solution to users during emergency situations. The application will help users prepare for emergencies, provide prompt assistance during emergencies, and facilitate communication with emergency contacts.
